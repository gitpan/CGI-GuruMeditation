CGI::GuruMeditation
===================

ABSTRACT

This is a small module accompanying the CGI module, allowing the display
of an error screen (somewhat resembling the "Guru Meditation" from
the good old AmigaOS) in case of abnormal termination of a CGI. The
module simply installs a $SIG{__DIE__} handler which sends a HTTP
response to STDOUT showing a HTML/CSS based screen which the Perl error
message and optionally an excerpt from CGI's source code where the error
occurred. This provides both optically more pleasant and functionally
more elaborate error messages for CGIs.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install
