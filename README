CGI::GuruMeditation
===================

ABSTRACT

This is a small module accompanying the CGI module, providing the
display of an error screen (somewhat resembling the classical
red-on-black blinking Guru Meditation from the good-old AmigaOS before
version 2.04) in case of abnormal termination of a CGI.

The module simply installs a $SIG{__DIE__} handler which sends a HTTP
response showing a HTML/CSS based screen which optionally includes the
Perl run-time error message, an excerpt from the CGI source code and the
Perl run-time environment variables. This provides both optically more
pleasant and functionally more elaborate error messages for CGIs.

This module supports both the regular CGI and the Apache/mod_perl CGI
environment.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
